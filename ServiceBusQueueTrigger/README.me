Connected the ingestion pipeline from Day 1 to Azure Cosmos DB for processed data storage.

Built the Queue-Triggered Python Azure Function to read messages from Service Bus and load corresponding files from ADLS.

Implemented schema validation, row-level quality checks, and duplicate transaction removal inside the function.

Added logic to classify transaction types such as ATM, UPI, based on file metadata.

Developed rule-based checks to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., rapid withdrawals, repeated failed UPI attempts).

Successfully wrote validated and enriched records into Cosmos DB containers: ATMTransactions, UPIEvents, and FraudAlerts.
